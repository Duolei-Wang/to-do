# to-do
 Something I decide to do.

# PLT
It conviced me that yhe Programming Language Theory (PLT) itself is if great value and charmingful.

Thus I decide combined with my Bachelor Thesis, I'll the the basic components of PLT, including the Computation, especially Lambda-Calculi for now, Type Theory, then the Proof Theory.

And also, I hope I'll be more familiar with Haksell and another daily used language.

Let's meet at the end. Bye~
